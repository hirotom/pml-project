This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Load source data
```{r}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", "pml-training.csv")
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", "pml-testing.csv") 
df_train <- read.csv(src.train)
df_test <- read.csv(src.test)
ncol(df_train)
```

Clean up training data by 
1. Removing data identification columns not relavent to prediction (first 7 columns)
2) Removing unused columns (having entirely NA values) in the test data.  These columns cannot be used as predictors in the model anyways.  
This reduces the number of columns from 160 to 53, which is more manageable. 
```{r}
df_train <- df_train[, -c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)]
df_test <- df_test[, -c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)]
df_train <- df_train[, colSums(is.na(df_test)) != nrow(df_test)]
df_test <- df_test[, colSums(is.na(df_test)) != nrow(df_test)]
ncol(df_train)
```

Split training data further into training and test subset
```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(32323)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=df_train$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
training <- df_train[inTrain,]
testing <- df_train[-inTrain,]
```

Model
```{r}
fit1 <- randomForest(classe ~. , data=training)
pred1 <- predict(fit1, testing[,-53])
confusionMatrix(pred1, testing$classe)
pred1test <- predict(fit1, df_test[,-53])

```

Model with k-fold cross-validation (5-fold) to reduce overfitting.
```{r}
fit2 <- train(classe ~ ., method="rf", data=training, trControl=trainControl(method="cv", number=5))
pred2 <- predict(fit2, testing[,-53])
confusionMatrix(pred2, testing$classe)
pred2test <- predict(fit2, df_test[,-53])
```

Prepare output result files as instructed.
```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(pred2test)

```
